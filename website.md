# Website & Checkout

**Q:** Why can’t I delete an item from my cart?
**A:** On smaller screens, the chat box may block the “remove” button. Minimize the chat window to access it, or contact support to remove the item.

**Q:** My order disappeared from my cart — what happened?
**A:** If an item sells out or your session times out, the system may remove it. Refresh and check availability, or call us for help.

**Q:** The chat pop-up is blocking checkout. How do I fix this?
**A:** Collapse the chat box using the “–” button or proceed in full-screen checkout mode.

**Q:** The site won’t let me proceed to payment by e-check/ACH—what should I do?
**A:** Clear cache/cookies and try a desktop browser. If it persists, place the order with another method or contact support to investigate.

**Q:** Can I remove an item if the “X” is hidden by chat?
**A:** Minimize the chat widget to reveal cart controls, or ask an agent to remove the item for you.

**Q:** I’m seeing repeated errors or the page is stuck—any tips?
**A:** Refresh the page, try a different browser/device, or open a private window. If it continues, contact support with screenshots.

**Q:** Can I place an order by phone if the website isn’t working for me?
**A:** Yes—call our trading desk during business hours for assistance.
