# Products & Inventory

**Q:** Are your silver and gold products authentic?
**A:** Yes. All products come directly from mints or verified distributors. All products that we buy back are testing upon arrival.

**Q:** What’s the difference between bullion, proof, and graded coins?
**A:** Bullion is for investment, valued at metal content plus premium. Proof coins are collector strikes with special finishes. Graded coins are certified by a third-party grading company (NGC/PCGS) for condition and authenticity.

**Q:** Why am I limited to only 1 coin when ordering?
**A:** Some limited deals and promotions (e.g., “at spot” offers) have purchase limits to give more customers access.

**Q:** Do Canadian Silver Maples ship in tubes?
**A:** Yes—if you buy current year coins, they will ship in tubes of 25; monster boxes of 500 (20 tubes). If you buy random year coins, packaging cannot be guaranteed.

**Q:** How many American Silver Eagles fit in a tube and monster box?
**A:** Tube: 20 coins. Monster box: 25 tubes (500 coins).

**Q:** Does MintCertified™ mean the coins are graded?
**A:** No—MintCertified™ indicates mint-sealed tubes, never opened and that they came direct from the mint. Individual coins are not graded unless you submit them to a third party grading service.

**Q:** My slab/capsule arrived scratched or opened—what should I do?
**A:** Please send photos to support. We’ll review and arrange a replacement or credit when appropriate.

**Q:** Can I request specific years or designs?
**A:** “Random year/design” items are fulfilled from current inventory and cannot be pre-selected. The only way to guarantee a specific year or design is to buy the specific SKU you want.
