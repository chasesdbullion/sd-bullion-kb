# Products & Inventory

**Q:** Are your silver and gold products authentic?
**A:** Yes. All products come directly from mints or verified distributors. Many are sealed, MintCertified™, or graded by NGC/PCGS.

**Q:** What’s the difference between bullion, proof, and graded coins?
**A:** Bullion is for investment, valued at metal content plus premium. Proof coins are collector strikes with special finishes. Graded coins are certified by a third-party grading company (NGC/PCGS) for condition and authenticity.

**Q:** Why am I limited to only 1 coin when ordering?
**A:** Some deals and promotions (e.g., “at spot” offers) have purchase limits to give more customers access.

**Q:** Do Canadian Silver Maples ship in tubes?
**A:** Yes—tubes of 25; monster boxes of 500 (20 tubes). Packaging may vary by year/mint.

**Q:** How many American Silver Eagles fit in a tube and monster box?
**A:** Tube: 20 coins. Monster box: 25 tubes (500 coins).

**Q:** Does MintCertified™ mean the coins are graded?
**A:** No—MintCertified™ indicates mint-sealed tubes verified for quality. Individual coins are not graded unless you submit them.

**Q:** My slab/capsule arrived scratched or opened—what should I do?
**A:** Please send photos to support. We’ll review and arrange a replacement or credit when appropriate.

**Q:** Can I request specific years or designs?
**A:** “Random year/design” items are fulfilled from current inventory and cannot be pre-selected. Specific-year listings will say so.
