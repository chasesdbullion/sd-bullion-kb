  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I limited to only 1 coin when ordering?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Some limited deals and promotions (e.g., “at spot” offers) have purchase limits to give more customers access.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do Canadian Silver Maples ship in tubes?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Yes—if you buy current year coins, they will ship in tubes of 25; monster boxes of 500 (20 tubes). If you buy random year coins, packaging cannot be guaranteed.</p>
