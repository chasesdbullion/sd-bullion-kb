  <h1>SD Bullion – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p>Last updated: September 3, 2025</p>

  <h2>Payments & Transactions</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What payment methods does SD Bullion accept?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> We accept bank wires, checks, money orders, credit/debit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin via BitPay / Crypto.com). Each method has different processing times and order limits.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I switch my payment method after placing an order?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Orders are locked to the selected method once submitted. In urgent cases (e.g., wire issues), contact support immediately to see if we can help.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there limits for bank wires?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Most banks allow large wires ($50k–$100k+). Confirm limits with your bank before placing a high-value order.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does SD Bullion accept money orders?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Yes. USPS money orders are accepted within payment limits. Larger orders typically require a bank wire.</p>

  <h2>Orders & Shipping</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can I track my order?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> When your order ships, we email tracking details. You can also log in to your account to view real-time status.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> My package shows delivered but I didn’t receive it. What do I do?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Contact support immediately. We’ll review tracking, file claims with the carrier if needed, and work with you on resolution.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I ship to an address different from my billing address?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> For first-time customers, shipments must go to the billing address. After a verified purchase history, alternate addresses may be available.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How many coins fit in a tube or monster box?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> American Silver Eagle tube: 20 coins. Monster box: 25 tubes (500 coins). Other coins vary — check product pages for packaging details.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> My order was duplicated — what should I do?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Contact us right away to cancel the duplicate before it ships.</p>

  <h2>Products & Inventory</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are your silver and gold products authentic?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Yes. All products come directly from mints or verified distributors. Many are sealed, MintCertified™, or graded by NGC/PCGS.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What’s the difference between bullion, proof, and graded coins?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Bullion is for investment, valued at metal content plus premium. Proof coins are collector strikes with special finishes. Graded coins are certified by a third-party grading company (NGC/PCGS) for condition and authenticity.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I limited to only 1 coin when ordering?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Some deals and promotions (e.g., “at spot” offers) have purchase limits to give more customers access.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do graded or MintCertified coins include free grading?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> No. MintCertified™ means the tube was sealed and verified directly from the mint — individual coins inside are not graded unless you pay for grading separately.</p>

  <h2>Pricing & Deals</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I check today’s gold and silver spot price?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Our live spot prices are updated continuously on the Gold Prices and Silver Prices pages.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you offer price matching?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Yes. Call our trading desk during business hours to request a price match against established dealers (APMEX, JM Bullion, etc.) for identical items.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to pay tax when I buy or sell coins?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Sales tax depends on your state. When selling, gains may be reportable for taxes — consult your tax advisor.</p>

  <h2>Accounts & Depository</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> I can’t log into my account. What should I do?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Use the “Forgot Password” link or contact support to reset your account. For SD Depository, contact us if you need access reset.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you provide account statements?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Yes. You can log in to view order history and statements. Depository storage customers may receive monthly or quarterly statements.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much does storage cost?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Storage fees depend on metal type and value. Fees are billed monthly and detailed on our Depository page.</p>

  <h2>Sweepstakes & Promotions</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I enter the Monster Box Sweepstakes?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Each eligible purchase automatically enters you. You can also sign up directly on the sweepstakes page.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How will I know if I won?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Winners are contacted directly by SD Bullion via email and/or phone.</p>

  <h2>Website & Checkout</h2>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why can’t I delete an item from my cart?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> On smaller screens, the chat box may block the “remove” button. Minimize the chat window to access it, or contact support to remove the item.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> My order disappeared from my cart — what happened?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> If an item sells out or your session times out, the system may remove it. Refresh and check availability, or call us for help.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> The chat pop-up is blocking checkout. How do I fix this?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> Collapse the chat box using the “–” button or proceed in full-screen checkout mode.</p>
