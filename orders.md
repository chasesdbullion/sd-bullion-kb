# Orders & Shipping

**Q:** How can I track my order?
**A:** When your order ships, we email tracking details. You can also log in to your account to view real-time status.

**Q:** My package shows delivered but I didn’t receive it. What do I do?
**A:** Contact support immediately. We’ll review tracking, file claims with the carrier if needed, and work with you on resolution.

**Q:** Can I ship to an address different from my billing address?
**A:** For first-time customers, shipments must go to the billing address. After a verified purchase history, alternate addresses may be available.

**Q:** How many coins fit in a tube or monster box?
**A:** It really depends on the coins you are buying. Some tubes hold 20 coins, while other hold 25 coins. For example, American Silver Eagle tube: 20 coins. Monster box: 25 tubes (500 coins). It's best to check product pages under "Details" for tube and box packaging details.

**Q:** My order was duplicated — what should I do?
**A:** Contact us right away to cancel the duplicate before it ships. Cancellation fees may apply.

**Q:** When will my order ship?
**A:** Card/PayPal/crypto orders typically queue for shipment within 1–2 business days. Check and wire orders ship after funds clear our account.

**Q:** Why is my order still “Processing”?
**A:** It remains Processing until payment clears and items move to fulfillment. Checks and e-Checks typically take 3–5 business days for funds to fully settle and clear into our bank account; wires: usually 1 business day.

**Q:** Can I cancel or change my order?
**A:** No. Orders are binding due to live metals pricing.

**Q:** Can I hold shipment or delay delivery?
**A:** Yes, there are options but only if your order hasn't shipped yet. Once packed, packages move quickly. Ask support before fulfillment begins to discuss hold options.
