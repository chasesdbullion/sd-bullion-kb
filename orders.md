# Orders & Shipping

**Q:** How can I track my order?
**A:** When your order ships, we email tracking details. You can also log in to your account to view real-time status.

**Q:** My package shows delivered but I didn’t receive it. What do I do?
**A:** Contact support immediately. We’ll review tracking, file claims with the carrier if needed, and work with you on resolution.

**Q:** Can I ship to an address different from my billing address?
**A:** For first-time customers, shipments must go to the billing address. After a verified purchase history, alternate addresses may be available.

**Q:** How many coins fit in a tube or monster box?
**A:** American Silver Eagle tube: 20 coins. Monster box: 25 tubes (500 coins). Other coins vary — check product pages for packaging details.

**Q:** My order was duplicated — what should I do?
**A:** Contact us right away to cancel the duplicate before it ships.

**Q:** When will my order ship?
**A:** Card/PayPal/crypto orders typically queue for shipment within 1–3 business days. Check and wire orders ship after funds clear.

**Q:** Why is my order still “Processing”?
**A:** It remains Processing until payment clears and items move to fulfillment. Checks: ~3–5 business days; wires: usually 1 business day.

**Q:** Can I cancel or change my order?
**A:** Orders are binding due to live metal pricing. If it hasn’t entered fulfillment, contact us immediately and we’ll review options.

**Q:** Do you ship to Canada or internationally?
**A:** We currently ship within the U.S. For storage, consider SD Depository. For exceptions, contact support.

**Q:** Tracking shows delivered to the wrong city/state—what now?
**A:** Contact support immediately. We’ll investigate with the carrier and work toward a resolution.

**Q:** Can I hold shipment or delay delivery?
**A:** Once packed, packages move quickly. Ask support before fulfillment begins to discuss hold options.

**Q:** What should I do if my package is lost, missing, or marked delivered but I didn’t receive it?
**A:** Contact SD Bullion support immediately. We will review the tracking details and open an investigation with the carrier. All orders are shipped fully insured. Once the carrier completes their investigation, we will work with you on a replacement or resolution. In some cases, packages marked “delivered” may arrive the next business day—please check around your property and with neighbors first.
