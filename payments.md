# Payments & Transactions

**Q:** What payment methods does SD Bullion accept?
**A:** We accept bank wires, checks, money orders, credit/debit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency (Bitcoin via BitPay / Crypto.com). Each method has different processing times and order limits.

**Q:** Can I switch my payment method after placing an order?
**A:** Orders are locked to the selected method once submitted. In urgent cases (e.g., wire issues), contact support immediately to see if we can help.

**Q:** Are there limits for bank wires?
**A:** Most banks allow large wires ($50k–$100k+). Confirm limits with your bank before placing a high-value order.

**Q:** Does SD Bullion accept money orders?
**A:** Yes. USPS money orders are accepted within payment limits. Larger orders typically require a bank wire.

**Q:** How do I pay with a check?
**A:** Choose “Check/Money Order” at checkout. Mail your check with the order number. Orders ship after funds clear (typically 3–5 business days).

**Q:** Do I get the wire/check price if I pay with a USPS money order?
**A:** Yes—USPS money orders qualify for the check/wire pricing tier within posted limits.

**Q:** Is a bank wire cheaper than paying by PayPal or card?
**A:** Usually, yes. Wires/checks have lower premiums. Card/PayPal include processing fees and may carry lower order limits.

**Q:** My bank asks if your account is checking or savings for the wire—what should I select?
**A:** Use the account type shown on your wire instructions page. If unsure, contact support before sending.

**Q:** Can I switch from PayPal/crypto to check after placing the order?
**A:** Orders are locked to the chosen method. Contact support immediately—if fulfillment hasn’t started, we may be able to help.

**Q:** Can I pay with a Crypto.com wallet?
**A:** Yes—select the BitPay/crypto option at checkout and follow the invoice steps from your Crypto.com wallet.

**Q:** BitPay says my payment is complete—did SD Bullion receive it?
**A:** You’ll get an email confirmation when the payment posts. If you don’t see it within an hour, share your BitPay invoice ID with support.

**Q:** Do you accept Zelle or Venmo?
**A:** Not at this time. Supported methods appear on the payment screen at checkout.
