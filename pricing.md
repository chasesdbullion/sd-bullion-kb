# Pricing & Deals

**Q:** Where can I check today’s gold and silver spot price?
**A:** Our live spot prices are updated continuously on the Gold Prices and Silver Prices pages.

**Q:** Do you offer price matching?
**A:** Yes. Call our trading desk during business hours to request a price match against established dealers (APMEX, JM Bullion, etc.) for identical items.

**Q:** Do I have to pay tax when I buy or sell coins?
**A:** Sales tax depends on your state. When selling, gains may be reportable for taxes — consult your tax advisor.

**Q:** If I find a better price the same day, will you match it?
**A:** Contact us with the competing link and quantity. We’ll review in real time and advise if we can match.

**Q:** Why is card/PayPal pricing higher than wire/check?
**A:** Card processors charge higher fees. Wire/check discounts reflect lower processing costs.

**Q:** How does the “silver at spot” promotion work?
**A:** Typically for first-time customers on eligible items. Discount shows at checkout. If you qualify and don’t see it, contact support.

**Q:** Are there any hidden fees?
**A:** No hidden fees. Your final price includes product premium, applicable taxes, and shipping/insurance if any are shown in checkout.

**Q:** Can I get bulk pricing?
**A:** Yes—contact the trading desk for tiered pricing on larger quantities.
