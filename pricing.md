# Pricing & Deals

**Q:** Where can I check today’s gold and silver spot price?
**A:** Our live spot prices are updated continuously on the Gold Prices and Silver Prices pages. You should also see the current price at the top of the page you are on.

**Q:** Do you offer price matching?
**A:** Yes. Call our trading desk during business hours to request a price match against established dealers for identical items. We may not be able to price match limited time promotions due to inventory constraints.

**Q:** If I find a better price the same day, will you match it?
**A:** Contact us with the competing link and quantity. We’ll review in real time and advise if we can match.

**Q:** Why is card/PayPal pricing higher than wire/check?
**A:** Automated payment methods like Card, PayPal and Bitpay require us to pay third party processing fees which get passed onto the customer. Wire/check/e-check discounts reflect lower processing costs.

**Q:** How does the “silver at spot” promotion work?
**A:** Typically for first-time customers on eligible items. Discount shows at checkout. If you qualify and don’t the discount reflected in your cart, contact support.

**Q:** Are there any hidden fees?
**A:** No hidden fees. Your final price includes product premium, applicable taxes, and shipping if any are shown in checkout. Our sales people do not work on commission.

**Q:** Can I get bulk pricing?
**A:** Yes—most bullion products we sell offer bulk discounted pricing tiers. These tiers will be outlined on each separate product page.
